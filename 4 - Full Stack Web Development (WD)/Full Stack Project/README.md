## Change of plan 
If you have come here looking for the full project code, sorry, but the plan has changed.

Although seeing code is nice, lets face it, reading other peoples code can be really hard and you don't really want to see Bongani's spaghetti React code.

You can still find the code for the backend in the eventApi and eventApi-Session-2 folders, this code includes a lot of comments and goes through all of the concepts that were covered in the live sessions.

**But what about the full stack aspect?**

I (Bongani) am currently working on an article that will cover the process of building a full-stack application, the article will include some useful tips and tricks as well as links to different resources, this will be a lot more valuable than reading through my React code and will hopefully set you up for developing applications beyond just the react eco-system.

Please come back tomorrow to check if the links have been uploadedüòÅ
